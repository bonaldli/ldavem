# LDA Variational EM Algorithm 

This **R** package implements the variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. This VEM algorithm is for the LDA full Bayesian model---Except for this, this implementation is quite similar to the original implementation of the LDA VEM algorithm by Dr. David Blei. 

This uses the following R packages: 
* Rcpp 
* RcppArmadillo
