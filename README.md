# LDA Variational EM Algorithm 

This **R** package implements the variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. This VEM algorithm is for the LDA full Bayesian model (Except for this additional feature, the implementation is quite similar to the orginal implementation of the LDA VEM algorithm by Dr. David Blei). 

This uses the following R packages: 

* Rcpp 
* RcppArmadillo
